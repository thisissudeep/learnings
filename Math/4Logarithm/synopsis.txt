log usecases:

1.LOg is used to identify the no of years(X) it takes the (basement value) to become (N)  
and also used to calculate how many times does the stick need to be rejoined or no of times you need to double the stick length(x),so that length 2(base) becomes length 32(N).



2.ANother use case of log is log transform in ml.
that pic is an exmaple of a loan should be approved for a specific person or not based on various 3 categories 
it is also a standard supervised learning problem

pooja has more salary than usual.hence when we train our ml model ,our model will get biased by this value

so if we aplly log income to it ,the values will become a comparable values. and the model will not get biased(model will have more accuracy) when we train in this value.




3.Measuring eaarthquake is also an another example of logarithm


4.log is used in loss function also
