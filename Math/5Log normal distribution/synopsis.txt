normal distribution is applicable for many areas(like test score,..) but it is not well in yearly income chart

if we apply log function to x axis , it becomes log normal distribution. here the chart is better


In realtime example,
A loan approvement eg.
here we take income as an independent variable in building ml model,then the model may get biased(may not get high accuracy) by this irregular value.Because ,the numbers on the similar scale the model will perform better.

Hence if we apply log transform in income ,then the values get similar .


Summarization:
If we have a log normal distribution,and if an outlier occured in the column which we gonna use as a main feature for training our ml model,then log transfromming that column will get more accuracy to out model
