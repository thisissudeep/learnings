Document Similarity:

in a bunch of documents ,we need to figure out what company the document belongs to.

in 1st, we anotate by it by using ratio 3;1,whenever this ratio occurs then the higher ratio's company is the document belongs to.
but using ratios not applicable in all datasets ,where the vector plays a role

in these graphs,  the angle betweeen the documents shows its similarity.ie)if the angle between the two documents are 0 (or) less angle difference ,
then the two are same documents(belongs to same company (or)speaks about same company)

document similarity is betterly identified using Range than in degree

COsine similarity is the cosine angle between the two vectors of documents

COsine similarity:
1 - similar documents
0 - different
-1 - opposite concept documents(different)

COsine distance:
0 - same documents
1 - different
