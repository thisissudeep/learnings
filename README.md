# Learnings

A compilation of my Data Structures, Algorithms, Java programs, and SQL practice. All written during my early learning phase. This repository includes hands-on code and rough notes organized by topic.



## What's Inside

- **Core DSA Concepts**:  
  Folders for BST, BT, Linked Lists, Stack, Queue, Graph, Matrix, and more.

- **Java Practice Files**:  
  Files like `DP.java`, `Recursion.java`, `Sorting.java`, and `arrayofobjects.java` with basic and intermediate implementations.

- **SQL Practice**:  
  A single `basic.sql` file containing foundational queries or schema designs.

- **VS Code Configs**:  
  Contains a `.vscode/` folder. I used **VS Code’s `#region` and `#endregion` tags** to structure and fold sections in the editor minimap for better navigation and clarity.



## Tools Used

- **Java** – Primary programming language
- **SQL** – Database fundamentals
- **VS Code** – Code editor with structured regions and minimap enhancements
